# Prediction_of_breastcancer_using_ML
Breast cancer is the second most severe cancer among all of the cancers already unveiled. With the rapid population growth, the risk of death incurred by breast cancer is rising exponentially. Early detection of disease has become a crucial problem in medical research. Machine learning methods are an effective way to predict data. Especially in medical field, machine learning methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions. An automatic disease detection system aids medical staffs in disease diagnosis and offers reliable, effective, and rapid response as well as decreases the risk of death. The goal of our project is to classify whether breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this, we have used machine learning classification methods namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN (k-Nearest-Neighbor) and Na√Øve Bayes. The results obtained are very competitive and can be used for detection and treatment. All the work will be done in the Google Collab  based on python programming language.
